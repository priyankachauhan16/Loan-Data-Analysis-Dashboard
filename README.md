📊 Loan Data Analysis Dashboard (Excel Project)

🔍 Overview
This project presents a detailed Loan Data Analysis Dashboard built using Microsoft Excel, aiming to explore and visualize the behavioral patterns of borrowers based on demographic and loan-related variables. It showcases how Excel can be effectively used for data-driven storytelling and financial analytics.

🎯 Project Objective
The objective of this dashboard is to analyze loan transactions and extract insights about:
-Which age groups are most likely to take loans
-How gender, education, and loan terms affect repayment behavior
-Trends in loan statuses (PAIDOFF, COLLECTION, COLLECTION_PAIDOFF)
-Distribution of principal amounts across education levels
-Time-based loan outcomes

📁 Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following fields:
Gender (Male, Female)
Age
Education (Bachelor, College, High School or Below, Master or Above)
Loan Amount (Principal)
Loan Status (PAIDOFF, COLLECTION, COLLECTION_PAIDOFF)
Loan Term (in days)
Effective Date

📊 Dashboard Features
-Loan by Age: Bar chart showing number of loans per age group
-Gender vs Loan Status: Horizontal bar chart visualizing repayment trends by gender
-Education vs Loan Status: Comparison of loan repayment across different education levels
-Principal Distribution: Combo chart for sum and average of principal amounts grouped by education
-Effective Date vs Loan Status: Timeline view of loan outcomes on specific dates
-Terms vs Loan Status: Breakdown of repayment by loan term durations (7, 15, 30 days)
-Transaction Percentage: Donut chart summarizing overall loan status distribution
-Interactive Filters: Slicers for filtering by Gender and Education

📌 Key Insights
Borrowers aged 26–30 were most active in taking loans
Female borrowers had a slightly better repayment rate than males
Higher education levels correlated with higher loan amounts and better payoff rates
Shorter-term loans (7 days) had the highest successful payoff counts

🚀 Future Improvements
Integrate Power Query for automated data cleaning
Use Python or Power BI for scalable and dynamic dashboards
Add machine learning models to predict loan defaults
